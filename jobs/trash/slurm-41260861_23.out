-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mamba:
   - Mamba is a drop-in replacement for conda, offering higher speed and
   more reliable environment solutions. - Do you really need conda/mamba??
   Do you know about python virtual environments??? We HIGHLY recommend
   using virtual envs instead. e.g. python -m venv my-environment - Remember
   you can change where conda environemnts are created (if you run out of
   space in your home directory) ``` $ conda config --env --prepend
   envs_dirs /path/to/my/project/on/fred/.conda/envs $ conda config --env
   --prepend pkgs_dirs /path/to/my/project/on/fred/.conda/pkgs ``` - To hide
   this message in the future, load the module with -q ``` $ module -q load
   conda ```
